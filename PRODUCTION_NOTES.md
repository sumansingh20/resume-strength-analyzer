# Production Deployment Notes

## Important Database Consideration

This application currently uses an **in-memory database** for development purposes. In production deployment:

### Current State
- ✅ All authentication features work perfectly in development
- ✅ User registration, login, profile management
- ✅ JWT token authentication with secure endpoints
- ⚠️ **Database resets on every deployment/restart**

### For Production Use
You'll need to replace the in-memory database with a persistent solution:

1. **Quick Options:**
   - Supabase (PostgreSQL) - Free tier available
   - PlanetScale (MySQL) - Free tier available
   - MongoDB Atlas - Free tier available

2. **Database Migration:**
   - Update `lib/db.ts` to use a real database
   - Keep the same interface for minimal code changes
   - Update environment variables

### Current Features Ready for Production
- ✅ Complete authentication system
- ✅ User profile management
- ✅ JWT token security
- ✅ Email notifications
- ✅ Responsive UI with dark/light theme
- ✅ File upload functionality
- ✅ Resume analysis (placeholder)

### Environment Variables Needed for Netlify
```
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-32-chars-min
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-different-secure-secret-key-32-chars-min
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Resume Strength Analyzer
```

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Netlify configuration ready
- ⚠️ Database persistence needed for production use
